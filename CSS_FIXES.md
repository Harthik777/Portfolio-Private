# CSS and Performance Fixes

This document provides a summary of the CSS fixes and performance optimizations implemented to address errors and improve the website's performance.

## CSS Fixes

### Issues Addressed
- Fixed `@tailwind` and `@apply` directive errors in CSS files
- Added proper PostCSS configuration for Tailwind CSS
- Created a CSS linting configuration to handle Tailwind directives properly

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Enhanced PostCSS Configuration**
   - Added `postcss-nesting` for proper CSS nesting support
   - Added `postcss-import` for better CSS import handling
   - Configured production optimizations with cssnano

2. **Stylelint Configuration**
   - Created `.stylelintrc.js` with rules to recognize Tailwind directives
   - Configured ignoreAtRules for Tailwind-specific directives

3. **CSS Fallbacks**
   - Created `tailwind-fixes.css` with CSS variable fallbacks
   - Added standard CSS equivalents for Tailwind utilities

4. **VSCode Configuration**
   - Added settings to disable CSS validation in favor of Stylelint
   - Configured automatic CSS fixes on save

## Performance Optimizations

### FuturisticLoader Component
The FuturisticLoader component was completely rewritten with extensive optimizations:
- Added device capability detection (mobile, tablet, low-end)
- Implemented reduced motion preference detection
- Added frame rate limiting based on device capability
- Created simplified rendering paths for low-end devices
- Added conditional canvas rendering (disabled for very low-end devices)
- Reduced node count and connection count based on device capability
- Simplified gradient calculations for better performance
- Implemented throttled resize handlers to prevent performance spikes

### Testing Tools
- Created a device testing script (`test-devices.js`) that simulates various device profiles:
  - Low-end mobile devices
  - Mid-range mobile devices
  - High-end mobile devices
  - Tablets
  - Low-end desktops
  - High-end desktops

### Build Process Improvements
- Added CSS linting scripts to package.json
- Added device testing script to package.json
- Enhanced PostCSS configuration for better CSS processing

## How to Use

### To Lint CSS
```bash
npm run lint:css
npm run lint:css:fix  # to automatically fix issues
```

### To Test on Different Devices
```bash
# Start the development server first
npm run dev

# In a separate terminal, run:
npm run test:devices
```

### Build with Optimizations
```bash
npm run build
```

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing a CSS-in-JS solution for better Tailwind integration
- Add automated performance testing with Lighthouse CI
- Further optimize images and assets for different device profiles
